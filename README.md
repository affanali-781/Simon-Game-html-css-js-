# Simon Game ðŸŽ®

A web-based version of the classic **Simon Memory Game**, built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** (with **jQuery**). The game challenges users to remember and reproduce sequences of colors that grow progressively longer.

The Simon Game is a classic memory-based game where the player must repeat an ever-growing sequence of colors generated by the system. Each round, the game highlights a random color (green, red, yellow, or blue) using animation and sound. The player must then click the colors in the exact order they were shown.

## ðŸ§  How to Play

1. **Press any key** to start the game.
2. The game will highlight a color (green, red, yellow, or blue).
3. **Repeat the pattern** by clicking the same color.
4. With each level, a new color is added to the sequence.
5. If you press the wrong color, the game ends and shows "Game Over."
